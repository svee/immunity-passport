There are two files with following parameters that you need to create:

1  ** Config.py

# Secret Keys, mail and Recaptcha configurations.
# Idea is not to add it to git repo.

SECRET_KEY = "setthistoyoursecretkey"


# This is just the output of one time call key = Fernet.generate_key()
MSG_ENCRYPTION_KEY=b'setthistooutputofFernet.generate.key'

MAIL_SERVER= 'smtp.mailtrap.io'

RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY='<private key from your account>'
RECAPTCHA_OPTIONS = {'theme':'white'}


2 ** app_settings.py

# Separated application specific settings/constants from config file.
